# JAVASCRIPT TODO LIST

This is a basic todo list using vanilla JavaScript and CSS. I've built this project to get a little more familiar with the basics of front-end development. The design is simple, clean and responsive. I've used three viewport width breakpoints to adjust the website to make it look good in any device. The code is commented as well as spaced into different sections to improve its readability.

## How to use

When you open up the website you can type your name at the top to make it feel a little bit more "your own". Then, on the "what's on your todo list?" field you can type your new todo item. After that, you need to pick a category for your new todo item (is it something personal or related to business?) and finally click on the big "Add Todo" to add your new todo item. Your todos will be listed below from newest to oldest. You can check, edit or delete your todos with the buttons to the right.

This project was based on a [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eFwtaZf6zc&list=PLWFvjo3KAk5-NtpeAoCmb7GaLghBsZjjK&index=3) by Tyler Potts. I've changed the color palette and organized the code a little differently. I've also added the feature of sorting the todos from newest to oldest.
