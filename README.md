This project was based on a [hello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eFwtaZf6zc&list=PLWFvjo3KAk5-NtpeAoCmb7GaLghBsZjjK&index=3 "Youtube Video") by Tyler Potts. I changed the color palette and organized the code a little differently. I also added the feature of sorting the todos from newest to oldest.
